/**
 * content-schema.js — SCHEMA_DEFAULTS is the baseline every site falls
 * back to. content-api.js does deepMerge(SCHEMA_DEFAULTS[site].KC_*, override)
 * for every read, and the Telegram admin bot's "reset to default" simply
 * clears the KV override doc for a site/key — after that, whatever is in
 * here is exactly what visitors see again.
 *
 * Regenerated from each site's own config.js (the file that ships with
 * the live site) so "reset to default" reproduces the current live
 * config exactly, instead of an older/stale baseline. To refresh this
 * again later, re-run extract-config.js + build-schema.js against the
 * latest config.js files for root / krem-chympe / wilderness-expedition.

Where you leave the ordinary world behind and step into something raw, real, and unforgettable. From the moment you leave the road, everything changes. The 4×4 rattles through rugged terrain that GPS doesn't even recognize. The trek pulls you into ancient forests where sunlight filters through leaves like gold dust. Waterfalls appear like secrets, hidden until you're standing right in front of them. And then — the cave.",

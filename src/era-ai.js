/**
 * era-ai.js — the optional knowledge-base auto-responder behind "ERA
 * AI", plus the learning controls exposed through the Telegram admin
 * bot. As of the live-chat-first redesign, every new visitor
 * conversation defaults to plain manual chat with the admin (see
 * conversations.js) — nothing here answers automatically unless the
 * admin has explicitly switched that specific conversation to "🤖 AI"
 * from Telegram. This file is what runs when a conversation IS in that
 * mode.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How it answers:
 *   1. LIVE INTENTS — pricing, refund policy, contact details, guide info
 *      are answered by reading the CURRENT content/pricing docs (the same
 *      ones the admin bot edits) so ERA AI never repeats a stale number.
 *      These always work, learning toggle or not — they're not "learned",
 *      they're just live lookups.
 *   2. KNOWLEDGE BASE — a small built-in set of generic Q&A (including
 *      casual small talk — greetings, thanks, "how are you", jokes,
 *      etc., each with several varied replies so ERA AI doesn't sound
 *      robotic on repeat visits), plus admin-taught entries (see
 *      teachAnswer / teachBulkAnswers below), matched by simple keyword
 *      overlap. Checked first because a confident KB match is usually
 *      better-phrased than raw site text.
 *   3. FULL-SITE SEARCH — every real sentence on the site (title, sub,
 *      descriptions, bios, policy text, everything) PLUS every freeform
 *      "info note" the admin has pasted in (see addAdminNotes below) is
 *      indexed as a "chunk" grouped by whichever section/card it
 *      belongs to. A visitor's question — however it's phrased — is
 *      matched by keyword overlap against that whole index, not just a
 *      hand-picked FAQ list, so any twist on a question whose answer
 *      genuinely exists somewhere on the site (or in something the
 *      admin fed it) can be found, wherever it lives. The site the
 *      visitor is chatting from AND the home/root site are both
 *      indexed, so general company questions work from any page.
 *   4. FALLBACK — if nothing matches confidently, ERA AI gives a graceful
 *      "not sure" reply and (only if learning is enabled) queues the
 *      question so the admin can teach it the right answer from Telegram.
 *
 * TELEGRAM IS THE STORAGE (same pattern as the rest of this backend —
 * see store.js): the knowledge base, admin info notes, unanswered-
 * question queue, and learning on/off flag are all persisted via
 * getDoc/saveDoc.
 *
 * ADMIN BULK TEACHING — the admin can paste an unlimited number of
 * question/answer pairs (or just plain paragraphs of info) from
 * Telegram at any time, in whatever format is natural to paste
 * (`Q:`/`A:` labels, a numbered list, "Question? -- Answer" on one
 * line, or blank-line-separated blocks). parseQABlob() below turns
 * that raw paste into structured pairs, teachBulkAnswers() adds them
 * straight to the knowledge base, and anything that isn't shaped like
 * a question gets kept as a searchable info note via addAdminNotes()
 * instead of being thrown away — so nothing the admin sends is wasted,
 * and there is no limit on how much or how often they feed it. See the
 * "📚 Bulk Teach Q&A" flow / `/teach` command in telegram-bot.js.
 *
 * THE "STOP LEARNING" TOGGLE — what it does and doesn't do:
 *   OFF only pauses ERA AI's passive knowledge growth: new unanswered
 *   questions stop being queued, so nothing new gets added to the
 *   knowledge base on its own. ERA AI keeps answering visitors exactly
 *   as before, using whatever it already knows. An admin can still
 *   manually teach it an answer (single or bulk) at any time — that's
 *   an explicit edit, same as editing site text — the toggle only
 *   affects automatic learning from visitor traffic.
